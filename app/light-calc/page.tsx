          Understanding the relationship between light intensity (PPFD) and
          duration (photoperiod) is crucial for plant growth. These charts
          provide valuable insights into recommended Daily Light Integral (DLI)
          targets for different plant stages and types, including specific
          guidance for autoflowering varieties. Use them as a guide in

            This calculator helps you find the Daily Light Integral (DLI), which
            is the total amount of PAR light received over a 24-hour period. DLI
            is a crucial metric for plant growth as it accounts for both light
            intensity (PPFD) and duration (photoperiod). Use this to ensure your
            plants get the right total amount of light per day. The formula is
            DLI = PPFD * hours * 3600 / 1,000,000.

            PPF (Photosynthetic Photon Flux) measures the total amount of PAR
            (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) light emitted by a source in
            micromoles per second (Î¼mol/s). LUX is a measure of illuminance
            perceived by the human eye. Converting PPF to LUX can give you a
            rough idea of how bright a grow light might appear, but its not
            useful for determining plant growth potential as plants use a
            different light spectrum than humans see most brightly. This
            conversion is highly dependent on the light sources spectrum.

            This calculator attempts to convert a LUX reading (human-centric
            light measurement) to PPF (plant-centric light measurement). While
            you might use a standard light meter that gives LUX readings, this
            conversion is **highly inaccurate** for grow lights because the
            relationship between LUX and PPF varies significantly based on the
            light sources spectral distribution (the mix of colors in the
            light). Use this tool only for very rough estimations; a proper PAR
            meter is needed for accurate PPFD/PPF measurements.

            Lumens measure the total amount of visible light emitted by a
            source, weighted according to human eye sensitivity. PPF measures
            the total amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
            relevant to plants. Plants utilize a different spectrum of light
            than humans perceive most brightly (e.g., they use more blue and red
            light, less green). Therefore, converting Lumens to PPF is **not a
            reliable method** for assessing a grow lights effectiveness for
            plants. This calculation is provided for informational purposes but
            is highly dependent on the lights spectrum and should not be used
